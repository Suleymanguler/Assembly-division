Instructions about the code.

This code is written in GNU SIM 8085

num1-num2 are numbers to be divided into. The order of numbers is not important, the program will automatically divide
the big number by the smaller one.

The output is going to be at I/O outports. 

Result will be in the port 02h
Remain will be in the port 01h

As an extra, the first decimal value is located at the end of the division operation in port 03h.

For instance if you give 12 as num2 and 5 as num2, 13/5 is 2 (stored at port 02h) and 3 (stored at port 01h) as 
remaining number. It is also equal to 2,6. So 6 is stored in port 03h.
